# visual-rdbms

This project is an experimental visual database management system built using Python and Pygame.

Instead of interacting with a database through SQL or text commands, this system attempts to represent database structures and operations visually while also allowing the use of commands. Tables, records, and relationships are treated as interactive objects on screen.

This was originally built as a school project, but the real goal was building an end-to-end software with responsive UI from scratch using just math libraries and a rendering framework.

Implementing the responsive UI using ratios and vignette/gradient effects using surface.setpixel() was the most difficult but fun part.
